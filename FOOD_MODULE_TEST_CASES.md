# Food Module — Exhaustive Manual Test Cases

Covers the UNILIV **Food Ordering & Kitchen Ops** module: order placement → kitchen
accept/reject/prepare → dispatch ("Load the van") → delivery confirmation → waste tracking,
plus masters (dishes, ingredients, menu rotation, composition rules, portion rules, cut-offs,
kitchens, brands, org hierarchy, agencies, user scopes), reports/analytics/exports, the public
menu-share link, RBAC, property scoping, and DB-level validation.

**API base:** all endpoints are under `/api/food` (both `food.ts` and `food-ops.ts` mount there).
Ad-hoc calls go through the proxy: `curl localhost:80/api/food/...`.

## 0. Test setup & reference data

### 0.1 Environment
- Default admin login: `admin@uniliv.com` / `Admin@123` (SUPER_ADMIN — org-wide).
- Servers run as Replit workflows (`API Server`, `web`). Never `pnpm dev` at root.
- DB inspection: query PostgreSQL directly (`food_orders`, `food_order_items`, `food_dispatches`,
  `food_order_events`, etc.). No migration files — schema applied via `drizzle-kit push`.

### 0.2 Seed data required before testing
| Item | Needed for |
|---|---|
| ≥2 properties, each with a **brand** and **kitchen** assigned (via pincode map or manual) | order placement, scoping |
| ≥1 property deliberately **without** brand/kitchen | "not configured" negatives |
| Active `food_brands` (e.g. `UNILIV`, `HUDDLE`) + one inactive brand | brand validation |
| Kitchens with unique `code`; `kitchen_pincodes` rows (6-digit, globally unique) | pincode → kitchen derivation |
| Dishes with `component`, `unit`, `brands[]`, `preparations[]` | menu, composition |
| `per_resident_rules` for the dishes (brand, mealType, dishId, qtyPerResident, unit) | quantity compute |
| `food_menu_rotation` rows (kitchen, brand, mealType, week, day, dish) | Kitchen Summary / preview |
| `food_cutoffs` row per brand (HH:MM) | cut-off enforcement |
| Agencies with vehicles + locations + `agency_kitchens` links | dispatch |
| Users of each role listed in §0.3 | permission tests |

### 0.3 Roles reference (Food)
| Role | Scope | Food access summary |
|---|---|---|
| SUPER_ADMIN, OPS_EXCELLENCE | org-wide | FULL on all 12 FOOD_* modules |
| AUDIT_READONLY | org-wide | VIEW on all FOOD_* |
| UNIT_LEAD | **property-scoped** | place/edit orders, confirm delivery, waste, all-orders VIEW, dashboard/reports VIEW; **no** kitchen-summary/dispatch/org |
| CLUSTER_MANAGER | org-wide (food self-scopes) | all-orders FULL, dispatch VIEW, receive/confirm/waste FULL; no kitchen-summary; no org/settings |
| CITY_HEAD, ZONAL_HEAD | org-wide | all-orders FULL, dispatch VIEW; no kitchen-summary/org/settings |
| SENIOR_VICE_PRESIDENT | org-wide | dispatch VIEW, kitchen-summary VIEW, place/confirm/waste VIEW, reports VIEW; **no FOOD_ALL_ORDERS** |
| FNB_SUPERVISOR | org-wide | kitchen-summary FULL, dispatch FULL; **no FOOD_ALL_ORDERS**; no settings/org |
| FNB_MANAGER | org-wide | kitchen-summary FULL, dispatch FULL, **FOOD_SETTINGS FULL**, RECIPES/MENU_PLANNING FULL; **no FOOD_ALL_ORDERS**, no FOOD_ORG; lands on `/food/kitchen-summary` |
| FNB_ZONAL_HEAD | org-wide | kitchen-summary FULL, dispatch FULL; no settings/org |
| Roles with **no** food access (negatives) | — | HR_MANAGER, OPERATIONS_MANAGER, PROCUREMENT_MANAGER, KITCHEN_MANAGER, PROJECTS_MANAGER, PROPERTY_ACQUISITION, FINANCE, SALES_EXECUTIVE, WARDEN, VENDOR_RESTRICTED, CUSTOMER_EXPERIENCE |

**FOOD_ORG** is granted **only** to SUPER_ADMIN / OPS_EXCELLENCE (FULL) and AUDIT_READONLY (VIEW).

### 0.4 State machines (reference for expected results)
**Order:** `PLACED → ACCEPTED → PREPARING → DISPATCHED → DELIVERED`; off-ramps
`PLACED/ACCEPTED → REJECTED`, `PLACED/ACCEPTED/PREPARING → CANCELLED`. Terminal:
DELIVERED / CANCELLED / REJECTED.

**Dispatch:** `LOADING → {IN_TRANSIT, CANCELLED}`; `IN_TRANSIT → {DELIVERED, PARTIAL, CANCELLED}`;
`PARTIAL → {DELIVERED, IN_TRANSIT}`; `DELIVERED` / `CANCELLED` terminal.

## A. Order Placement (Unit Lead / place-order)

`POST /api/food/orders` (single meal), `POST /api/food/order-batches` (multi-meal), draft APIs,
and the Food Overview place-order UI.

### A1. Happy path
| ID | Title | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1-01 | Place single-meal order (API) | As UNIT_LEAD, `POST /orders` with valid `propertyId`, `mealType=LUNCH`, `serviceDate` (future, before cut-off), `quantity=25` | `201`; `data.status=PLACED`, `unitLeadId`=caller, `totalQuantity=25`, `orderNumber` matches `ORD-YYYY-000001` format; `items[]` computed from per-resident rules; a `food_order_events` PLACED row exists |
| A1-02 | Place multi-meal batch | `POST /order-batches` with 3 meals for one property/date | `201`; one `food_order_batches` row (`BATCH-YYYY-######`), one `food_orders` row **per meal**, each PLACED; each linked via `batchId` |
| A1-03 | Item quantities auto-compute | Place order qty=10, dish rule `qtyPerResident=0.15 KG` | item `orderedQty = round(10 × 0.15 × 1000)/1000 = 1.5 KG` |
| A1-04 | Dish without per-resident rule is skipped | Menu has dish A (has rule) + dish B (no rule) | Order items include only dish A; dish B omitted |
| A1-05 | `expectedDeliveryAt` resolved | Property/brand has a meal window with serviceTime + leadTime | `expectedDeliveryAt = serviceDate@serviceTime + leadTimeMinutes` |
| A1-06 | Place order via UI | Food Overview → Tomorrow's order → set headcount → Send | Confetti + success toast; order appears in All Orders as PLACED |
| A1-07 | Per-item edit in UI | Pencil-edit a dish qty before sending | Only items with `orderedQty > 0` are submitted; edited qty persists |

### A2. Negative / validation
| ID | Title | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| A2-01 | Missing required field | `POST /orders` without `quantity` | `400 "propertyId, mealType, serviceDate, quantity required"` |
| A2-02 | Invalid mealType | `mealType=BRUNCH` | `400 "Invalid mealType: BRUNCH"` |
| A2-03 | Zero / negative quantity | `quantity=0`, then `-5` | `400 "quantity must be a positive number"` |
| A2-04 | Non-numeric quantity | `quantity="abc"` | `400 "quantity must be a positive number"` |
| A2-05 | Unparseable serviceDate | `serviceDate="not-a-date"` | `400 "Invalid serviceDate"` |
| A2-06 | Property not accessible | UNIT_LEAD of property P1 orders for P2 | `403 "Property not accessible"` |
| A2-07 | Property missing brand/kitchen | Order for the unconfigured property | `422 "This property is not configured for ordering (missing brand or kitchen)."` |
| A2-08 | Past service date | `serviceDate` = yesterday | `422 "Cannot place an order for a past date."` |
| A2-09 | After cut-off | serviceDate=today, current time past cut-off | `422 "Ordering for DD/MM/YYYY is closed — the HH:MM cut-off has passed."` |
| A2-10 | Beyond next service day | serviceDate too far ahead | `422 "Orders can only be placed for the next service day (DD/MM/YYYY)."` |
| A2-11 | Duplicate meal (batch) | Place LUNCH, then batch containing LUNCH again same property/date | `409 "An order for the selected meal(s) already exists for this date."` |
| A2-12 | Batch missing meals | `POST /order-batches` with empty `meals` | `400 "propertyId, serviceDate and at least one meal required"` |
| A2-13 | Batch invalid serviceDate | bad date | `400 "Invalid serviceDate"` |
| A2-14 | Duplicate meal partial | Batch of LUNCH(exists)+DINNER(new) | `201`; only DINNER created, LUNCH silently skipped as already-ordered |

### A3. Edge cases
| ID | Title | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| A3-01 | Cancelled meal re-orderable | Place LUNCH → cancel it → place LUNCH again same date | Second placement succeeds (dedup ignores CANCELLED/REJECTED) |
| A3-02 | Order-number seq gap-proof | Delete highest order row, place new order | New `orderNumber` = max+1 (derived from max, not count) |
| A3-03 | Fractional headcount UI step | KG/L dish uses step 0.5; PLATE/PCS uses step 5/1 | Stepper honors unit-specific step |
| A3-04 | Headcount min 1 | UI stepper at 1, press minus | Stays at 1 (min enforced), no max |
| A3-05 | Large quantity | `quantity=100000` | Accepted; items scale (watch numeric(12,3) range) |
| A3-06 | Inactive brand on property | Property brand code deactivated | Placement should fail config/brand validation (verify behavior) |
| A3-07 | Menu empty for meal | Property configured but rotation has no dishes for that meal/day | Order created with **no items** or meal skipped — verify no crash |

### A4. Server-side drafts
| ID | Title | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| A4-01 | Save draft | `PUT /order-draft` `{propertyId, serviceDate(yyyy-MM-dd), payload}` | `200 {updatedAt}`; upsert on (userId, propertyId, serviceDate) |
| A4-02 | Read draft | `GET /order-draft?propertyId=..&serviceDate=yyyy-MM-dd` | Returns `{payload, updatedAt}` or `null` |
| A4-03 | Delete draft | `DELETE /order-draft?...` | `200 {data:null}`; row removed |
| A4-04 | Bad draft key | `GET /order-draft` no propertyId | `400 "propertyId required"` |
| A4-05 | Bad serviceDate format | `serviceDate=2026/07/17` | `400 "serviceDate must be yyyy-MM-dd"` |
| A4-06 | Oversize payload | `PUT` payload > 64 KB JSON | `413 "payload too large (max 64KB)"` |
| A4-07 | Draft property not accessible | Draft for a foreign property | `403 "Property not accessible"` |
| A4-08 | Draft isolation | User B reads user A's draft key | Returns null (drafts keyed per authenticated user) |
| A4-09 | Past-day cleanup | Save draft, advance day, save another | Prior past-day drafts opportunistically deleted |
| A4-10 | UI autosave | Type in place-order form | Debounced 800 ms autosave; restored on reload once; switching property resets |

| M-06 | FOOD_SETTINGS write gate | FNB_SUPERVISOR (no settings) | `POST /dishes` | `403` |
| M-07 | FNB_MANAGER has settings | FNB_MANAGER | `POST /dishes` | `201` |
| M-08 | AUDIT_READONLY view-only | AUDIT_READONLY | `GET` any food route → OK; any `POST/PUT/DELETE` | reads `200`; writes `403` |
| M-09 | SVP no all-orders | SENIOR_VICE_PRESIDENT | `GET /orders/:id` (FOOD_ALL_ORDERS) | `403`; dashboard shows "no order-level tracking" panel |
| M-10 | Dispatch VIEW vs EDIT | CLUSTER_MANAGER (dispatch VIEW) | `GET /dispatches` OK; `POST /dispatches` | list `200`; create `403` |
| M-11 | Cancel inline perm | role without place/kitchen edit | `POST /orders/:id/cancel` | `403 "Forbidden — insufficient permissions"` |

---

## N. Property scoping / multi-tenancy

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| N-01 | UNIT_LEAD sees own only | UNIT_LEAD of P1 | `GET /orders` | only P1 orders |
| N-02 | Foreign detail blocked | UNIT_LEAD of P1 | `GET /orders/:id` for P2 order | `403 "Order not accessible"` |
| N-03 | Org-wide sees all | SUPER_ADMIN | `GET /orders` | all properties |
| N-04 | Scope rows expand | CITY_HEAD with CITY scope | list orders | city → kitchens → properties expanded |
| N-05 | **Empty scope sees nothing** | user with scope rows resolving to empty set | `GET /orders` | `data:[]` (NOT all) |
| N-06 | Zero scope fallback | BROAD_FALLBACK role (FNB_MANAGER) with no scope rows & no propertyId | list | falls back to all properties |
| N-07 | UNIT_LEAD no fallback | UNIT_LEAD with no scope rows | list | property-scoped (never all) |

## O. API response format & route mechanics

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| O-01 | Success envelope | any success | `{success:true, data:...}` |
| O-02 | Create returns 201 | any POST create | `201` |
| O-03 | Validation error shape | bad body | `400 {success:false, error:"Invalid request", details:<zod flatten>}` |
| O-04 | Internal error | force a 500 | `{success:false, error:"Internal server error"}`, no stack trace |
| O-05 | Passthrough bodies | send extra keys | ignored, request still valid |
| O-06 | Numeric coercion | qty fields | returned as Number not string (e.g. totalQuantity, qtyPerResident) |
| O-07 | Soft vs hard delete | dishes/ingredients/brands/agencies (soft, 404 if missing) vs rotation/rules/composition/zones/cities/clusters/scopes/agency-locations/agency-vehicles/meal-windows/cutoff-config (hard, no 404) | delete semantics per §F/G/H/I |
| O-08 | Route-order traps | `/orders/track`, `/orders/dispatch/bulk`, `/dispatches/active-vehicles`, `/menu-rotation/{resolve,slot,validate,auto-fill,export.*,bulk}`, `/reports/export.csv` | static/literal routes win over `:id`/`:fmt` |

---

## P. Database validation

Since there are **no DB CHECK constraints**, verify the **app layer** rejects bad values and the DB
integrity/uniqueness holds.

| ID | Title | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| P-01 | orderNumber unique | attempt two orders with same number (or force collision) | UNIQUE violation; app retries number gen (5 attempts → `500 "Failed to generate order number"`) |
| P-02 | Unique constraints | duplicate `food_brands.code`, `kitchens.code`, `kitchen_pincodes.pincode`, `food_dispatches.dispatchNumber`, `food_order_batches.batchNumber`, `food_menu_shares.shareToken` | DB rejects duplicate |
| P-03 | Composite uniques | `agency_kitchens(agencyId,kitchenId)`, `food_cutoffs(brand,propertyId)`, `food_order_drafts(userId,propertyId,serviceDate)`, `food_meal_config.mealType` | duplicate rejected |
| P-04 | **Cascade: delete order** | delete a `food_orders` row | its `food_order_items` + `food_order_events` removed |
| P-05 | Cascade: delete agency | delete agency | locations, vehicles, kitchen links removed |
| P-06 | Cascade: delete user | delete a user | `user_scopes` + `food_order_drafts` removed |
| P-07 | NOT NULL enforcement | insert `food_order_items` without `orderedQty` | DB rejects (NOT NULL) |
| P-08 | Enum enforcement | insert `food_orders.status='FOO'` directly | DB rejects (pgEnum) |
| P-09 | App invariant wastedQty | via API `wastedQty > cap` | app `400` (DB itself would accept — app must guard) |
| P-10 | pincode global uniqueness | map same pincode to two kitchens | second insert rejected (pincode UNIQUE) → deterministic derivation |
| P-11 | serviceDate day-anchoring | drafts / order dedup use 00:00 IST anchor | same-day rows match; different day distinct |
| P-12 | Order events append-only | perform lifecycle transitions | one `food_order_events` row per transition, none mutated |
| P-13 | Dispatch events append-only | dispatch lifecycle | one `food_dispatch_events` row per status change |
| P-14 | totalQuantity consistency | after edit headcount | `food_orders.totalQuantity` = sum of recomputed item orderedQty |
| P-15 | wasteEditableUntil set | after confirm-delivery | column = deliveredAt + configured window ms |

---

## Q. End-to-end lifecycle (integration)

| ID | Title | Flow | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-01 | Full happy lifecycle | Place → Accept → Prepare → Load van → Depart → Deliver → Waste | each transition succeeds, events logged, notifications fired, DB consistent |
| Q-02 | Reject path | Place → Reject | REJECTED terminal; no dispatch possible |
| Q-03 | Cancel pre-dispatch | Place → Accept → Cancel | CANCELLED; slot re-orderable |
| Q-04 | Dispatch cancel reverts | Prepare → Load → Cancel trip | orders revert to PREPARING, dispatch fields cleared, re-dispatchable |
| Q-05 | Partial delivery | trip with 2 orders, deliver 1 | trip PARTIAL; delivered order DELIVERED, other DISPATCHED |
| Q-06 | Shortfall → complaint | Deliver with received < ordered | auto complaint TKT created, variance event, waste window opens |
| Q-07 | Multi-meal batch lifecycle | Batch of 3 meals, advance each independently | each order own lifecycle; batchId shared |
| Q-08 | Edit after dispatch notifies | Dispatch → edit headcount | items recomputed, notify kitchen, audit event |
