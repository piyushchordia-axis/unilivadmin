# UNILIV Admin Portal

A multi-property co-living management platform covering operations, residents, complaints, laundry,
HR, procurement, kitchen, sales CRM, finance, and analytics — built as a pnpm monorepo with React +
Vite (web), Express + Drizzle ORM (API), and PostgreSQL.

## Architecture

```
artifacts/
  uniliv-admin/    React + Vite + TS web app
  api-server/      Express + Drizzle + JWT API
  mockup-sandbox/  Component preview / design canvas
lib/
  db/              Drizzle schema + client (shared)
  api-spec/        OpenAPI spec + Zod schemas
  api-client-react/  Generated React Query hooks
```

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push        # apply schema to PostgreSQL
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run seed # seed demo data (if available)
```

Workflows are managed by Replit:

- `artifacts/api-server: API Server` → Express on `:8080`, served at `/api`
- `artifacts/uniliv-admin: web` → Vite dev server, served at `/`

For ad-hoc requests use the shared proxy: `curl localhost:80/api/healthz`.

| SUPER_ADMIN | All (full) |
| HR_MANAGER | Employees, Recruitment, L&D, Users, Settings (view) |

## Notification System

Auto-generated per-user notifications: `COMPLAINT_SLA_BREACH`, `PAYMENT_OVERDUE`,
`LEAVE_APPROVAL_PENDING`, `INDENT_APPROVAL_PENDING`, `LOW_STOCK`, `DOCUMENT_EXPIRY`,
`LEASE_RENEWAL`. The bell in the topbar polls `/api/notifications` every 30 seconds.

API:

- `GET /api/notifications` — last 20 + unread count
- `PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read`
- `PATCH /api/notifications/read-all`

## Health Check

```
GET /api/healthz → { status: "ok" }
```

## Deployment

Replit autoscale deployment configured via the artifact toml files. Build + start are managed per
artifact; the shared proxy multiplexes `/api/*` to the API server and everything else to the web
app. Set `DATABASE_URL` and `SESSION_SECRET` in Replit Secrets before publishing.
